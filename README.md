This project is a simple web api application that manage uploading, eaditing and deleting customer information
best practices and design patterns are used in this project as much as possible considering the time constraints.
please notice that docker compose will not run successfully as It needs some more time and investigations to work properly
to run the api please update the appsettings.json file with the connection string to your local database, please make sure the user has db create permission
select https profile and run the application
api will run on https://localhost:7244
attached postman collection to test the api
also there is small react project covering most of the api endpoints
I would have loved to do more like include logging, unit tests and more but could not fit it in the time frame
please let me know if you have any questions or need any clarifications
